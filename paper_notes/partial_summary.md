While there is substantial literature evaluating the performance of model selection criteria (MSC), including the Bayes factor, in comparing two nested models, less has been written specifically examining the case when the models are non-nested or overlapping. Here, we define consistency in the selection process as (1) choosing inferior models with probability converging to 0 and (2) choosing the model with the highest degree of parsimony (least complexity in parameters and also random distance function) with probability converging to 1. 

Casella et al. (2009) state that â€œAs far as we know, a general consistency result for the Bayesian model selection procedure for non-nested models has not yet been established." Chib and Kuffner (2016), in a survey of Bayes factors in various settings, have stated that the BIC is generally inconsistent when selecting among non-nested models.

Hong and Preston (2005) consider the setting of comparing two parametric models $f(y,\beta)$ and $g(y,\alpha)$ which draw from a single source of data y and optimize for their parameters beta, alpha through minimizing some random distance functions $Q$ and $L$, including log-likelihoods. Considering general model selection criteria of the form $MSC=\hat{Q}(\beta)-\dim(f,Q)C_T$, with $C_T$ a constant depending on the sample size $T$, they show that the Bayes factor, posterior odds ratio, and BIC are equivalent under some technical assumptions and fit this criteria with $C_T=O(\log T)$. Consequently, they perform inconsistently for non-nested models. Susko (2017) found that for non-nested settings, even when two models have the same number of parameters, Bayes factors can have strong biases toward particular models.

Work in special cases, however, reveals that the Bayes factor can be consistent. Giron et al. (2010) investigate a special case, showing that when the dimensionality of the models is bounded by $O(n^\alpha)$ with the sample size being $n$ and $\alpha<1$, the Bayes factor for intrinsic priors when dealing with two non-nested linear models is consistent, and as an extension, the BIC is consistent.
